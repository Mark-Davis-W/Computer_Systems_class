mine allocates 0x18 which is 24 bits for the stack of the program
-inserting all 0's with one 01 at beginning and the instruction needs to be reversed at beginning of line to input correctly to the stack because of how it reads the code



there is a srand it looks like so maybe could seed a value I want to know where things will be evantually

there is a strtod which I think is the string to decimal
used the compile, encode, & dump to get the code needed for buffer

in phase2 i needed to push touch2 onto stack to return to
then mov cookie into rdi register then c3 to ret
-figured out if I don't put the code in sequential order
 -the 00's cause the program to try and do add's to $al register
 -switching to using "no op" 0x90 for rtarget

in phase3 i overflowed to go back to my buf and code
-using same procedure as before but calling touch3
-also needed a "safe" place for my hex cookie
 -overflowed it past the return address I added
 -calculated and used this add as exploit code calling touch3

phase4 in Rtarget
-overflow into established stack calling functions needed
 -find and calcute address needed setval264 then addval 174
 -found i needed to pop old rax with first gadget
 -then use my cookie, which I found needed to be backward like addr
 -then second gadget to do move into rdi
 -then call the touch2 function

phase 5 in Rtarget?
