Started out in recitation doing loop unrolloing of the planes
I initiated local variables for many things
 -so they don't have to calculate each time through the loop
  -some are constants like widths and height for the for loop compares
  -some replace the function calls with constants like getSize/getDivisor
  -
  
first value in filter is size 3 for 3x3 file
second value is the divisor
